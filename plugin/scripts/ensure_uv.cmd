rem certutil prints a header, the digest, then a success line, redirected to a FILE -
rem never captured as a command's own output. This file no longer parses that output
rem at all, after four rounds of trying to and getting it wrong four different ways:
rem   1. Capturing via a single-quoted command string (no usebackq) whose first
rem      character, once %CERTUTIL% expanded, was a literal double quote. cmd.exe's
rem      for /f parser mishandled that and the loop ran zero times: ACTUAL stayed
rem      empty, and empty-vs-real-checksum was reported as a mismatch.
rem   2. Switching that same capture to usebackq with a backtick-quoted command runs
rem      the command through cmd /c, and cmd /c strips the outer quotes of a command
rem      line that begins with a literal double quote. That produced "The filename,
rem      directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect" on a real windows-latest
rem      runner, and left ACTUAL holding parser leftovers (observed as a bare "=")
rem      instead of empty or a digest - again reported as a mismatch, because nothing
rem      checked ACTUAL's shape before comparing it.
rem   3. Reading certutil's stdout from a file (no command-capture) still did not
rem      yield a valid digest on a real windows-latest runner, for a reason nobody
rem      could see because the raw file was deleted before anyone could look at it.
rem      Fixed by dumping the raw file to stderr on failure (that dump stays, below)
rem      and adding a PowerShell fallback (that stays too).
rem   4. The dump then showed certutil exiting 0 with the byte-for-byte correct
rem      digest sitting right there in the file, while this file's own line-scanning
rem      parser (a nested `for %%c in (0 1 2 ... F)` stripping hex characters from a
rem      delayed-expansion variable, itself inside a per-line `for /f`) still decided
rem      no line was a valid digest. :dump_raw and :validate_digest read the exact
rem      same file with the same `for /f` primitive and disagreed - proof the defect
rem      was in the string-parsing machinery itself, not in which bytes were where.
rem The fix is to stop parsing the digest out of the file at all. certutil already
rem printed it; the only question is whether it equals EXPECTED, and findstr can
rem answer that without extracting anything: `findstr /c:"<expected>" file` succeeds
rem if and only if that exact string appears somewhere in the file. No for /f over
rem the digest text, no delayed-expansion substring surgery, no nested for, no
rem normalisation, no assumption about which line or byte holds what - the entire
rem class of bug this file has been fighting cannot occur here, because nothing here
rem reconstructs the digest as a string this file's own logic could get wrong.
rem
rem Soundness: matching EXPECTED anywhere in the tool's output is safe specifically
rem because that output cannot contain an attacker-chosen 64-hex-character string.
rem certutil's -hashfile output is exactly the path we asked it to hash (built from
rem our own %RANDOM%, inside our own data root, never from the downloaded archive's
rem contents) plus the digest it computed; Get-FileHash's output is nothing but the
rem digest itself. Neither tool ever echoes bytes from the file being hashed. Do not
rem "tighten" this back into a parser - that is exactly what kept failing.
