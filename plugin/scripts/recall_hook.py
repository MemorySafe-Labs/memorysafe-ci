"""SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hook: make recall happen in a fresh session.

Why this exists
---------------
capture_hook makes capture reliable; nothing made recall reliable. The server only ever
sees tool calls, so a memory is recalled only if the assistant chooses to call
memorysafe_find, and a coding task gives it no reason to. Measured on 4 Nov 2026 (Dora's
real-model pilot, round 1): session 1 captured four preferences into one protected memory;
sessions 2 and 3, fresh Claude Code sessions on the same store, never called MemorySafe,
and the preferences went unused.

What it does
------------
At SessionStart it reads the store, read-only, and hands the assistant the memories that
are stable enough to carry into every session: protected ones and preferences, newest
and most important first, capped in number and length so the cost is a few hundred input
tokens, not a transcript. On a prompt that reads like a task (build, fix, add, write, ...)
it adds the stored preferences again, as rules to apply in this task and to check before
finishing (0.4.32; a pilot round showed the session-start block read and not followed by
task time), and one line asking for a memorysafe_find call, which is where project memories
come from and what records a recall in the store.

What it deliberately does not do
--------------------------------
It never writes the store (mode=ro), so a recall shown this way is not counted as one;
memorysafe_find counts. It injects nothing when the store is absent or empty, and nothing
on a prompt that is not a task. It carries no secret: the server's filters refuse secrets,
credentials and IDs at capture time, so the store holds none to show.

Runs on Python 3.8 with the standard library only; the wrapper may pick the system python3.

Exit codes: always 0. A SessionStart hook must never stop a session from starting.
