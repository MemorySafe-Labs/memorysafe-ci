"""UserPromptSubmit hook: make MemorySafe auto-capture fire reliably.

Why this exists
---------------
An MCP server only ever sees tool calls, never the conversation. So automatic
capture can only happen if the assistant *chooses* to call the capture tool --
and measured over two weeks of daily use, it chose to exactly once.

This hook removes the choice from chance without removing it from judgement:
the harness runs this on every prompt (deterministic), and when the message
looks like it carries a durable user-stated fact, it injects an instruction
telling the assistant to offer the candidate. Detection is mechanical here;
extraction stays with the model, which is the part models are actually good at.

One exception, decided 4 Nov 2026 by the product owner after a real-model pilot in
which, in two rounds, the model ignored the capture hint and saved nothing: a PLAINLY STATED
PREFERENCE ("always use Black", "I prefer pytest", "from now on, no new
dependencies") is saved by this hook itself, without the model in the loop. It is
the one shape a pattern can judge, and it is the shape the product promises to
keep. The write goes through the same door as the tool: capture_policy.skip_reason
(secrets, contacts, IDs, health, length) and MemoryStore.remember with
source="automatic" (dedupe, merge, importance), so nothing this hook saves could
not have been saved by memorysafe_auto_capture. Everything else in a message is
still the model's to judge, through the hint below. The store code is imported
from the plugin's own src/ with the runtime Python; where that import fails
(system Python without the runtime), the hook falls back to the hint.

Gated on automatic mode
-----------------------
The hook ships inside the Claude Code and Codex plugins, so it runs for people who never
turned automatic mode on. After the cheap pattern match it reads the automatic_mode
setting from the store, read-only, and stays silent unless the mode is on: someone who
never opted in sees no extra tool calls and pays no extra tokens.

Runs on Python 3.8 with the standard library only; the wrapper may pick the system python3.

Exit codes: always 0. A capture hint is never worth interrupting a turn for.
