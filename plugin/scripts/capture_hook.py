"""UserPromptSubmit hook: make MemorySafe auto-capture fire reliably.

Why this exists
---------------
An MCP server only ever sees tool calls, never the conversation. So automatic
capture can only happen if the assistant *chooses* to call the capture tool --
and measured over two weeks of daily use, it chose to exactly once.

This hook removes the choice from chance without removing it from judgement:
the harness runs this on every prompt (deterministic), and when the message
looks like it carries a durable user-stated fact, it injects an instruction
telling the assistant to offer the candidate. Detection is mechanical here;
extraction stays with the model, which is the part models are actually good at.

Deliberately NOT done here: writing to the store directly. Regex cannot judge
what is worth keeping, and a memory product whose store fills with junk has
lost the thing it sells. Every write still goes through the server's
governance -- automatic-mode check, sensitive-content and secret filters,
length cap, importance/confidence floors -- which refuses anything unsafe even
if this hook is wrong about a candidate.

Gated on automatic mode
-----------------------
The hook ships inside the Claude Code and Codex plugins, so it runs for people who never
turned automatic mode on. After the cheap pattern match it reads the automatic_mode
setting from the store, read-only, and stays silent unless the mode is on: someone who
never opted in sees no extra tool calls and pays no extra tokens.

Runs on Python 3.8 with the standard library only; the wrapper may pick the system python3.

Exit codes: always 0. A capture hint is never worth interrupting a turn for.
