"""What automatic capture refuses, and why.

The guard this replaces tested the label, not the payload. It was a keyword regex
over phrases like "email address" and "home address", so it blocked someone
*saying* "email address" and saved an actual one:

    BLOCKED  "My card number is 4111 1111 1111 1111"   (a separate value check)
    ALLOWED  "Her email is someone@example.com"
    ALLOWED  "She lives at 1 Example Street, Montreal"

Two reviewers converged on two rules that are now the shape of this module.

**Name the shape, never echo the value.** A refusal is recorded in
decision_events and surfaces in health and governance output. A reason that
quotes what it refused re-leaks the secret into the very log meant to prove we
did not keep it. Callers get a stable shape name they can act on; the payload
never leaves this function.

**Negative tests matter more than positive ones.** A false skip costs one
memory. A false save breaks a promise. But a detector that fires on every
version number, port, date or dollar amount makes automatic capture useless and
gets switched off, which costs every memory. Every pattern here is paired with
things it must not match, in tests/test_capture_policy.py.
