"""Find the assistants on this computer, and connect each one to the same MemorySafe store.

The store is already shared: every host's launcher resolves the same data root, so one
SQLite file serves Claude Desktop, Claude Code and Codex. What was not shared was the
install. A user who installed the Claude Desktop extension still had to find, read and
follow a separate route for Claude Code and another for Codex, and nothing told them
which of their assistants were connected. Installing once has to be enough.

So this module answers two questions for every assistant it knows: is it on this
computer, and is MemorySafe connected to it. It connects one only through that
assistant's own installer (`claude plugin ...`, `codex plugin ...`), never by writing
its configuration by hand: 0.3.x's setup_assistants.py did that, and the result was the
double registrations `migrate` now exists to remove.

Claude Desktop is found and reported but never connected from here. Its extensions are
installed only after the user confirms them inside Claude Desktop; that confirmation is
the host's safety boundary, not a gap for us to route around.

Nothing here reads memory content. Connecting reaches the network, through the
assistant's installer, only when the user asks for it: `memorysafe connect --apply`, the
dashboard's Connect button, or the dashboard's one-time question "connect your other
assistants too?". A yes to that question is remembered (read_auto_connect), and then an
assistant installed later is connected when the dashboard service next starts. Nothing
is ever connected before that yes. Each assistant is connected automatically at most
once: one it has tried, or found connected, is settled, so an assistant the user has
since disabled or removed MemorySafe from stays that way.
